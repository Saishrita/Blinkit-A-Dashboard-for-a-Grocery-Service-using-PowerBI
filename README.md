# Blinkit Sales and Inventory Analysis (Power BI Project)

## Project Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analytical solution for Blinkit, focusing on sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal is to extract key insights and identify opportunities for optimization through interactive dashboards and visualizations.

The project addresses critical business questions by defining specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizing various aspects of the business, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Business Requirement

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations in Power BI.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements

The following KPIs are central to understanding Blinkit's performance:

1.  **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2.  **Average Sales:** The average revenue per sale.
3.  **Number of Items:** The total count of different items sold.
4.  **Average Rating:** The average customer rating for items sold.

## Chart & Visualization Requirements

The Power BI dashboard will include visualizations to address the following objectives:

5.  **Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size:**
    * **Objective:** Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
6.  **Sales by Outlet Location:**
    * **Objective:** Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
7.  **All Metrics by Outlet Type:**
    * **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) broken down by different outlet types.

## Granular Analysis Requirements

To delve deeper into specific aspects of the business, the project also covers:

1.  **Total Sales by Fat Content:**
    * **Objective:** Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
    * **Additional KPI Metrics:** Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
2.  **Total Sales by Item Type:**
    * **Objective:** Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
    * **Additional KPI Metrics:** Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
3.  **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:**
    * **Objective:** Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
    * **Additional KPI Metrics:** Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
4.  **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:**
    * **Objective:** Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
